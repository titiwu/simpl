simpl - A Simple Music Player
===============

The goal of this project is to create a simple to use (mp3) music player for children.
On the hardwareside a Raspberry Pi will be used, but any other should work as well (GPIO Pins assumed). The design is inspired by ["Hoerbert"](https://de.hoerbert.com/), however it will have more features (but need more power).
